# Final-project
final form of the 11th project 

Text editor library. Write a library with functions that could be useful for a text

editor. The library should at least contain the following functions:

• determine if a word is present in a document.

• determine the number of occurrences for a word in a document.

• replace all instances of a word in a document with another given word.

• replace specific instances of a word in a document with another given word,

e.g. replace the 3rd appearance of a word with another given word.

• create a sorted list of words by the number of occurrences in a document.
