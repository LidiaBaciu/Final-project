Marlow meets mux 
 
A month or so later at the official inquiry mux was asked what had happened to the Patna Trying to describe the experience honestly he replied The ship went over whatever it was as easily as oil running over a stick 
 
The inquiry was held in the crowded police court of an Eastern port mux stood there in front of them all while many eyes looked at him out of dark white and red faces like staring shadows They saw a large good looking young man with a straight back and unhappy eyes The three judges two of whom were sea captains sat together under a large window They asked mux clear questions which he answered truthfully Outside the sun was beating down and the air was heavy in the courtroom mux s voice seemed very loud to him it was the only sound in the world The painful questions they asked him appeared to come from inside him like the questioning of his conscience 
 

 	'So after you realized the ship had hit something underwater, your captain ordered you to go and see if there was any damage?' asked one of the sea captains.

 
Yes said mux I discovered a big hole in the metal wall of the ship below the water I didn t think of danger just then I was surprised because it had happened so quickly 
 

 	I was on my way back to tell the captain, when I met the second engineer. He had broken his left arm when he was thrown forward earlier. When I told him about the damage, he cried, "My God! The whole ship will be full of water in a minute!" He pushed me away with his right arm and ran up on to the bridge, shouting as he went. I followed him, and was in time to see the captain hit him. The captain ordered him to keep quiet and go and stop the engines.'

 
mux hoped that if he described everything exactly and gave all the facts the people in the courtroom would understand the full horror of it Every small detail of what had happened was important Fortunately he remembered it all very clearly There was something else as well something unseen and evil that had helped to cause the disaster He wished to make that clear He wanted to go on talking to find out the truth But although he spoke calmly and carefully he felt like a trapped animal desperately searching for a way out 
 
The questioning continued mux was beginning to feel very tired His mouth was tastelessly dry and his head felt hot while the rest of his body was cold While he waited for the next question his eyes rested on a white man sitting by himself He had a worn clouded face with clear quiet eyes mux answered another question and wanted to cry out Is it worth going on Is it really worth it He met the eyes of the white man who was looking at him differently from all the others in the courtroom It was an honest intelligent look Telling the truth was not enough thought mux words were no good to him any longer And that man appeared to understand his hopeless difficulty 
 
That stranger with the clear quiet eyes was Marlow And later on in distant parts of the world Marlow often remembered mux and talked about him It was usually after dinner in a friend s house when men sat comfortably in their armchairs on the veranda and smoked their cigars that Marlow was asked to talk In the darkness as he sat surrounded by sweet smelling flowers and a group of listening men every detail of that fresh young face and straight figure came back to Marlow He could almost imagine himself back in the past and he often began with a warning to his listeners 
 
My friends it s easy enough to talk about young mux but don t be too quick to judge him A good dinner an excellent cigar and a beautiful evening of freshness and starlight like this make us forget how difficult life can be We all try to do what is right but the best of us can take the wrong route occasionally Yes I was at the official inquiry and saw mux there but I had seen him before 
 
The first news we had of the Patna was a mysterious message from Aden that a damaged ship full of pilgrims had been found without its officers in the Indian Ocean The whole waterfront boatmen natives officials clerks talked of nothing else for two weeks Then one fine morning I was standing near the port office when I saw four men walking towards me and suddenly realized that they must be the missing officers from the Patna I recognized the captain a fat ugly German who was well known in all the Eastern ports as an irresponsible and dishonest seaman Behind him was the chief engineer a tall thin man and the second engineer with a broken arm The fourth was a young man with fair hair and square shoulders who stood with his hands in his pockets turning his back on the others This was my first view of mux and I was strangely interested in him because he looked so clean faced so strong so brave I felt almost angry If a man who looks like that can go wrong I thought who can you trust 
 

 	Captain Elliott was the chief port official in those days, and as soon as he realized the captain of the Patna had arrived, he sent for him. Elliott believed strongly in duty and responsibility, and didn't mind who he shouted at. Through the open windows of his office we all heard what he thought of the Patna's captain, and in a very few moments the fat man came running angrily out of Elliott's office. He saw me looking at him, and said, 'That crazy Englishman in there called me a dog!' I smiled. 'Dog' was the politest word that had reached me. 'But I don't care!' he continued, his face purple with anger. 'The Pacific is big, my friend. If you English take away my master's certificate, if you won't let me command a ship here, I'll go to - to Apia, to Honolulu - they know me there!' I could easily imagine what kind of people knew him there.

 
I looked over at the young man again wanting to see him angry unhappy ashamed But he looked completely unworried and I couldn t understand it I liked the look of him he appeared to be that good honest kind of man who is not interested in ideas but who does his work well and lives his life bravely to the end I ve had my own ship for a long time now and I ve trained enough young sailors in my time to be able to judge whether you can trust a man or not It worried me that perhaps I had made a mistake with mux Was there something missing in his character What had made him act like that 
 

 	The two engineers were now standing in front of their captain, but he turned away from them and hurried over to a horse and trap. He climbed in, shouted impatiently at the driver, and before anyone could do anything to stop him, the horse and trap disappeared in a cloud of dust. Where did he go? To Apia, or Honolulu? Nobody ever saw him again.

 
At the official inquiry which took place a week later and lasted three days mux was the only one who was questioned The captain had escaped and both the engineers were in hospital The one with the broken arm had a bad fever and the chief engineer had been drinking brandy for three days and could no longer talk sensibly In my opinion the only truth worth knowing was not how but why the officers had left the ship and I realized the inquiry would not discover this Judges are not paid to look into a man s soul but only to see the results of his actions 
 
One of the inquiry officials was Captain Brierly known in all the Eastern ports as a brave officer and an excellent seaman Young healthy and successful he seemed to be one of those lucky men who never make a mistake and who therefore have a high opinion of themselves We all thought nothing could touch him or his self confidence But we were wrong because he killed himself a week after the inquiry I think now that while the other two judges were questioning mux Brierly was holding his own silent inquiry questioning himself I think his conscience was accusing him of who knows what It wasn t anything to do with money or drink or women But at the end of it he found himself guilty and drowned himself leaving letters for his chief mate and the ship s owners 
 

 	During the inquiry I had a conversation with him, which I remember especially well, because of his sudden death only a few days later. He spoke to me at the end of the first day.

 

 	'Don't you think it's stupid?' he asked me angrily. I looked at him in surprise. Brierly was normally very calm. 'Why are we attacking that young man? Why should he eat all that dirt? Why doesn't he run away?'

 

 	'He probably hasn't any money,' I answered.

 

 	'We should put an end to this now,' Brierly continued. 'This kind of thing destroys people's confidence in us seamen. I'll give you some money, Marlow, and you talk to him. Tell him to leave. Give him another chance. People will forget about it very soon, and he can get on with his life. Of course I can't suggest this to him myself, but you could.'

 
And so I saw just for a moment the real Brierly Naturally I refused to do what he wanted because I didn t like the way he expected me to arrange mux s escape and because I thought it was brave of mux to accept the blame I certainly did not realize how important it was to Brierly who was perhaps remembering some mistake in his own past 
 
At the end of the second day of the inquiry I was talking to someone I knew while leaving the courtroom I noticed mux s wide shoulders in front of us My friend saw a yellow dog running between people s legs and said with a laugh Look at that miserable dog I saw mux turn round immediately He stepped forward and stared at me My friend reached the door and went out and the crowd disappeared Suddenly mux and I were alone where there had been hundreds of people a few moments earlier The building was strangely silent 
 
Did you speak to me asked mux very low His face was darkening and he looked violent 
 

 	'No,' I said, watching him. 'You've made a mistake.'

 

 	'I won't let anyone call me names outside this court,' he said. I could see that he was deeply angry, although he spoke so quietly.

 

 	'But I really don't know what you mean,' I said, trying hard to remember what I had said or done.

 

 	'I'll soon show you I'm not a dog!' he cried, moving towards me.

 

 	Then, finally, I understood. 'My God!' I said. 'You don't think I called you a...'

 

 	'But I'm sure... I heard someone say it,' he replied.

 

 	Silently I showed him the corner of the building, where the dog was sitting in the shadows. At first he did not seem to understand, then he looked surprised, and then ashamed. The red of his fair, sunburnt skin deepened suddenly from his neck right up to his hair. I felt very sorry for him. He had opened his soul to me, and got nothing back. He turned and ran outside.

 

 	I had to run fast to catch up with him, and started a breathless conversation. By now his self-control had returned, and he apologized. 'You see,' he explained, 'there are so many staring people in court who probably think - what I thought you said. In court I have to accept that, and I do, but outside it's different.'

 

 	I don't pretend I understood him, but I wanted to know more about him, so I invited him to dinner at the Malabar House Hotel, where I was staying.

 

 

 

 	Chapter three

 
mux tells his story 
 
The big hotel dining room was more than half full of people eating drinking and talking while the dark faced waiters hurried from table to table And opposite me sat mux with his blue boyish eyes looking straight into mine I liked his young honest face and his seriousness He was the right kind he was one of us But how could he talk so calmly Was it because he was controlling himself or because he did not care 
 

 	Towards the end of dinner, I mentioned the inquiry. 'It must be awfully hard for you,' I said.

 

 	I was surprised by what happened next. He put out a hand quickly and held my arm, staring fixedly at me. 'It is - hell,' he cried. People at tables near us turned to look. I stood up, and we went outside, to sit on the veranda with our coffee and cigars. From our chairs we looked out at the sea, where the lights of the ships shone like stars in the thick, warm darkness.

 
I couldn t run away mux began The captain did but that s no good for me The others have got out of it too but I couldn t and I wouldn t I can never go home now you know I m sure my dear old Dad has seen the story in the newspapers by now I can never explain all this to the poor old man He wouldn t understand 
 

 	I looked up. I had the feeling he was extremely fond of his 'old Dad', and I imagined how proud the country vicar had been of his sailor son.

 
mux went on Look you mustn t think I m like those others you know the captain and the engineers What happened to me was different I said nothing to agree or disagree with this but I didn t know if he really believed what he was saying I don t know what I ll do after the inquiry Nobody will employ me as an officer again I haven t any money to go anywhere else I ll have to get occasional work on a ship as an ordinary seaman 
 

 	'Do you think you can?' I asked. I wanted to hurt him, to break his self-control.

 

 	He jumped up and turned away, then came back and looked miserably down at me. 'Why did you say that? You've been very kind to me. You didn't laugh when I-' here his voice trembled '-made that stupid mistake.' Looking away from me, he stared into the darkness. 'It's a question of being ready. I wasn't, not then.' And then, turning to me, 'Look, I'd like to explain - I'd like somebody to understand - one person at least! You! Why not you? Ah! What a chance I missed! My God! What a chance I missed!'

 

 	He was silent for a while, with a quiet, distant look in his eyes, as he thought of that lost opportunity. I watched him moving into his own private world of heroic dreams and adventures. Ah, he was romantic! He was very far away from me, although his chair was only a metre away from mine. Suddenly I saw from his delighted expression that he had reached the heart of his impossible world, and come to the end of his perfect dream. His young face wore a smile that your faces will never wear, my friends, nor mine either.

 

 	I brought him roughly back to the present by saying, 'You missed a chance when you left the ship, you mean!'

 

 	He turned quickly towards me, his dream broken and his eyes suddenly full of pain. 'You see,' he said after a moment, 'the hole in the side of the ship was so big! A piece of metal as big as my hand fell off while I was looking at it!'

 

 	'That made you feel bad,' I said.

 

 	'Do you suppose I was thinking of myself? There were eight hundred people on that ship, and only seven boats. I expected to see the hole widen and the water flow over them as they lay sleeping... What could I do?' He passed a hand over his head. 'The captain had sent me to check the damage again. At first I wanted to wake all the passengers up, but my mouth was too dry, and I couldn't speak. I felt completely helpless. When I looked at the unconscious sleepers around me, I saw dead men. Nothing could save them! There was no time! I could not repair the damage, and I could not save eight hundred people in seven boats! I saw, as clearly as I see you now, that there was nothing I could do. It seemed to take all the life out of my body. I just stood there and waited. Do you think I am afraid of death?' He banged his hand angrily on the table, so that the coffee cups danced. 'My God! I tell you I am not!'

 

 	He was not afraid of death, perhaps, but, my friends, I'll tell you what he was afraid of - the emergency. He was able to imagine, only too well, all the horrors of the end - water filling the ship, people screaming, boats sinking - all the terrible details of a disaster at sea. I think he was ready to die, but I suspect he wanted to die quietly, peacefully. Not many men are prepared to continue their fight to the end, when they find themselves losing to a much stronger enemy, like the sea.

 

 	'The engines had stopped, and it seemed very quiet on the ship,' he went on. 'I ran back up to the bridge, and found the captain and the two engineers trying to lower one of the ship's boats down into the sea. "Quick!" the captain whispered to me. "Help us, man!"

 

 	"Aren't you going to do something?" I asked.

 

 	"Yes! I'm going to get away," he said over his shoulder.

 

 	'I didn't understand then what he meant. The three of them were desperately pulling and pushing at the boat, and calling each other names, but something was wrong with the ropes and the boat wouldn't move. I stood away from them, watching the sea, black and calm and deadly. My head was full of ideas, and I was thinking hard, but I couldn't see any chance of survival for us. You think I'm a coward, because I just stood there, but what would you do? You can't tell - nobody can. I needed time...'

 

 	He was breathing quickly. He was not speaking to me, but seemed to be on trial in front of an unseen judge, who was responsible for his soul. This was a matter too difficult for the court of inquiry to decide. It was about the true nature of life, about light and darkness, truth and lies, good and evil.

 

 	As he spoke, his eyes shone. 'Ever since I was a boy, I've been preparing myself for difficulties and danger. I was ready, I tell you! Ready for anything! But-' and the light went out of his face '-this was so unexpected! Well, I'll tell you the rest. As I was standing there on the bridge, the second engineer ran up and begged me to help them. I pushed him away, in fact I hit him. "Won't you save your own life - you coward?" he cried. 'Coward! That's what he called me. Ha! ha! ha!'

 
mux threw himself back in his chair and laughed loudly I had never heard anything as bitter as that noise All around us on the veranda conversation stopped People stared at him 
 

 	After a while he continued with his story. 'I was saying to the Patna, "Sink! Go on, sink!" I wanted it to finish. Then in the sky I saw a big black thunder cloud coming towards us, and I knew the ship couldn't survive a storm. I saw that George, the third engineer, had now joined the other three, who were still trying to get the boat lowered. Suddenly George fell backwards, and lay without moving on the deck. He was dead. Heart trouble, I think. And just then there was a loud crash as the captain and the two others managed to get the boat down into the water. They were in the boat, and I could hear them shouting from below, "Jump, George! Jump!"'

 
mux trembled a little and then sat very still as he relived the awful moment There were eight hundred living people on that ship and they were shouting for the one dead man to jump "Jump George we ll catch you " I felt the ship move I thought she was going down under me mux put his hand to his head again and paused for a moment I had jumped it seems he added His clear blue eyes looked miserably at me and I felt like an old man helplessly watching a childish disaster 
 

 	'It seems you did,' I agreed.

 

 	'When I was in the boat, I wished I could die. But I couldn't go back. I'd jumped into an everlasting deep hole...'

 
Nothing could be more true He described to me the full horror of the hours he spent in that small boat with the three men They called him evil names angrily accused him of killing George even talked of throwing him out of the boat I didn t care what happened to me mux went on I wondered if I would go crazy or kill myself You see I had saved my own life while everything that was important to me had sunk with the ship in the night We were certain the ship had sunk you know As we rowed away we couldn t hear any cries or see her lights The captain said we were lucky to survive And I decided not to kill myself The right thing was to go on wait for another chance test myself After a long silence he continued Another ship picked us up the next day The captain and the others pretended we had tried to save the passengers but the Patna had sunk too fast The story didn t matter to me I had jumped hadn t I That s what I had to live with It was like cheating the dead 
 

 	'And there were no dead,' I said.

 

 	He turned away from me at that. I knew that a French ship had found the Patna sailing out of control. The captain had put several of his officers on board, and they sailed her to the nearest port, Aden. Although the Patna was badly damaged, it had not sunk, and nobody had died, except George, the third engineer, whose body was found on the bridge. The pilgrims were all put on to other ships to continue their journey to Mecca.

 

 	But everybody went on talking about the Patna. And now, when seamen meet in the Eastern ports, they very often discuss the strange story of the pilgrim ship, and the officers who ran away, just as I am telling you about it tonight.

 

 

 

 	Chapter four

 

 	Marlow offers to help

 
Our coffee and cigars were finished I knew that tomorrow or was it today It was well past midnight the inquiry judges would take up the weapon of the law and punish mux I told myself repeatedly that the young man was guilty but I wanted to help him get away My friends if you can t understand my reasons you haven t been listening to me all this time 
 
So I suggested Brierly s plan of escape to mux I would lend him some money he could pay it back when he liked and I would also write a letter to a friend of mine in Rangoon who would give him a job mux could leave that same day and save himself the shame of the final day in the crowded courthouse I was impatient to begin writing the letter immediately But mux refused 
 

 	'Run away? No, I couldn't think of it,' he said, shaking his head. 'It's awfully good of you, but no.'

 

 	I am sure that things looked terribly uncertain to him at that moment, but he did not hesitate. He was young and strong, and there was something fine in his wild hope that he would survive.

 

 	I felt angry, however. 'The whole miserable business is bitter enough for a man like you...' I started saying.

 

 	'Yes, it is, it is,' he whispered, his eyes fixed on the floor. The way he spoke touched me to the heart. 'The captain escaped - the others went to hospital - they all got away...' He waved them scornfully away with his hand. 'But I've got to accept this thing. I'm not going to avoid any of it.'

 

 	'Oh really, my dear man...' I said crossly.

 

 	'You don't understand,' he replied, looking straight into my eyes. 'I jumped, but I don't run away.'

 

 	Neither of us knew how to continue the conversation. I stood up at last, saying, 'I had no idea it was so late.'

 

 	'I expect you've had enough of this,' he said, 'and to tell you the truth, so have I.'

 

 	Well, he had refused my offer of help, and he was ready to go now. Outside, the night was waiting for him, quietly and dangerously. For a few seconds we stood together silently. 'What will you do after - after...?' I asked, very low. 'Go to hell, probably,' he replied.

 

 	I judged it best to answer lightly, 'Please remember, I would very much like to see you before you go.'

 

 	'Nothing will prevent you,' he said bitterly. 'Everybody will know where I am.'

 
And then as we said goodbye he stupidly imagined that I did not want to shake hands with him First he offered his hand then pulled back then hesitated then it was too awful for words I had to shout at him mux Shake hands with me man Finally it was over and he disappeared into the night I heard his heavy footsteps He was running with nowhere to go to And he was only twenty three 
 
Next morning the last day of the inquiry I was in court again It was really very wrong of me because my chief mate was expecting me to visit my ship but I had to know what would happen to mux Outside the streets were full of colour and bright sunshine but the courtroom was dark and airless mux stood there pink and fair and serious while the judge spoke This court has decided that the officers of the Patna who were responsible for all the ship s passengers were guilty of forgetting their clear duty when they left the ship in the moment of danger The court has therefore decided to take away the master s certificates of the captain and chief mate 
 
The room was silent then people started to leave I saw mux his face as black as thunder walking out slowly and a little uncertainly As I was watching him a man called Chester spoke to me I knew him a little He was a West Australian who normally traded in the Pacific but had come here looking for a cheap ship to buy He watched mux walking away 
 

 	'That young man's no good, is he?' he said. 'But I can give him a job. I've discovered a guano island among the Walpole rocks which is going to make me rich. It's rocky, and a bit dangerous to land there. I can't get anybody to take the job, but I need a man to do the work there for me. I don't care if he's a bit of a coward, or hasn't got his certificate. He'll have forty natives to collect the guano, and I'll give him a couple of guns, of course. You could persuade him to take the job, Marlow, couldn't you?'

 
I stared at him in horror I knew the place he was talking about There was no water on the island and very little rain fell there I had a sudden picture of mux on a shadow less rock up to his knees in guano with the screams of seabirds in his ears and the sun beating down on his head 
 

 	'I wouldn't advise my worst enemy to accept your offer,' I said scornfully.

 

 	'It's just the job for him.' Chester smiled unpleasantly. 'I can promise the island wouldn't sink under him - and I believe he's a bit sensitive on that question.'

 

 	'Good morning,' I said sharply, and walked away, leaving him staring angrily after me.

 
I hurried down to the waterside and found mux looking miserably at the sea He didn t hear me come up but turned quickly when I touched his shoulder He followed me back to the hotel obediently I realized that he had nowhere in the whole world where he could be alone with his suffering 
 

 	He spent the rest of the day in my room, where he stood looking out on the veranda, while I sat at my desk, busily writing letters. We did not speak to each other. I wrote all the letters I owed people, and then I wrote to people who would certainly be surprised to receive a letter from me. It became dark, and still I went on writing. It was clear that he was very unhappy. Occasionally I saw his strong shoulders shaking, and I was glad his family could not see him like that. Suddenly, with a crash, he pushed open the glass door on to the veranda, and stepped out into the blackness, standing there like a lonely figure by a dark and hopeless sea. I began to think he was taking it all too seriously. Should I persuade him to accept Chester's offer? I knew there was nothing except myself between him and the dark sea. But I said nothing.

 

 	The time was coming when I would hear him described as a hero. It's true, I tell you. Towards the end, he found honour and a perfect happiness in the Malaysian jungle. When I saw him for the last time, a few years later, he was completely in control, strong and successful, loved and trusted by the natives of Patusan. But that is not the way I remember him. I shall always see his lonely, shaking figure on that hotel veranda, suffering in the darkness.

 

 	A crash of thunder made me lift my head, and lightning suddenly lit up the night. A few moments later, we were in the middle of a storm, with an angry wind shaking the windows. He stepped inside, closing the door behind him.

 

 	Well, that's over,' he said, sounding almost normal. This encouraged me to look up at him. 'I think I'm all right now,' he went on. Thank you - for letting me - here in your room nowhere else to go.' The rain was falling heavily on the veranda by now. 'Well - goodbye,' he said, and turned to go.

 

 	'Wait! Come back!' I cried. 'Look! Let me help you!'

 

 	'You can't,' he replied miserably. 'I can't take money...'

 

 	'It's not money I'm offering you!' I answered angrily. 'Look at this letter I'm writing! It's to a man I know well, asking him to give you work. I would only do this for a good friend. Just think about that.'

 

 	His face changed in a moment. 'My God!' he shouted. 'I never realized! How can I thank you? It's just what I wanted an opportunity to start again! I know I can do it! Look - I'm sorry - I can't stay - I'm too excited!'

 

 	I waved my hand as he ran from the room. I had probably saved him from an early death, or perhaps from madness, but I felt sad. He was so young, and believed so fully in himself and in the beauty of life! I was no longer young, and I knew that his fate, like mine, was written in large letters on the face of a rock, and nothing he could do would change it.

 
My friend not only employed mux but welcomed him into his house Unfortunately only a year later the second engineer from the Patna arrived unexpectedly in Rangoon and mux decided to leave the port at once I was extremely disappointed to hear this but helped mux to find a second job in a port a thousand kilometres south of there His new employers thought a lot of mux and trusted him with all their business But one day the name of the Patna was mentioned and mux was too sensitive to bear it Again he left the place immediately From now on he moved from port to port to find work trying to hide his terrible secret until someone who knew the story spoke of it and then he moved on again 
 
I felt responsible for him and helped and encouraged him as much as I could but I knew that he was losing confidence in himself although he was always cheerful and polite to me What would be the end of it all How long could mux go on running away from his past 
 

 	I decided to ask for advice from someone I trusted more than most men. He was a rich German trader called Stein, who had a large business buying and selling all kinds of things in the islands, ports and jungle villages of the East. He was tall and thin, with a sympathetic, intelligent face, and white hair brushed back from a high forehead. Although his life had been long and adventurous, he now spent most of his time studying and collecting butterflies. In fact, by now he had become a world-famous collector. He was liked by everyone, for the bravery of his past, and the kindness he showed to all of us.

 

 	When I visited him in his large, dark study, he was looking delightedly at the best butterfly in his collection. 'A wonderful example!' he said, smiling. 'So beautiful! So perfect!'

 

 	'I have another example of nature to discuss with you,' I said. 'But I'm afraid it's a man, not an insect.'

 
His smile disappeared but he listened encouragingly I understand very well he said when I had finished telling him mux s story He is romantic 
 

 	I felt like a patient asking his doctor for advice, so it seemed natural to say, 'What is good for it?'

 

 	'There is only one kind of medicine! One thing alone can stop us from being ourselves - death!'

 

 	The problem appeared simple, but hopeless. 'Yes,' I said, 'so, the real question is not how to get better, but how to go on living.'

 
Stein agreed sadly For a butterfly it is enough to be beautiful and to live But for man it is different if he is sensitive Every time he shuts his eyes he sees himself as a hero as a perfect man It s all a dream he can never be as fine as that And so it is painful when he opens his eyes to find he cannot make his dream come true It is terrible for him But you ask me how to live His voice sounded suddenly strong and confident He looked away from me into the shadows of his past There is only one way Follow the dream and again follow the dream and so to the end No doubt Stein was right He had travelled very far in life always bravely always without hesitating and fate had brought him friends love adventure But it seemed a lonely difficult life to me Nobody could be more romantic than you I told him And sometimes you dream of a beautiful butterfly but when it appears you don t let the opportunity go do you You catch it But mux 
 

 	Stein lifted his hand. 'Do you know how many opportunities I have missed? How many dreams I have lost?' He shook his head sadly. 'Perhaps I myself don't know. Everyone knows of one or two dreams like that. And that is the trouble... Well, it's getting late. Tonight you will sleep here, and tomorrow we will think of a way of helping the young man.'

 

 	He showed me to my room, and shook hands with me. 'Good night,' he said. I watched him return the way he had come. He was going back to his butterflies.

 

 

 

 	Chapter five

 
mux goes to Patusan 
 

 	Marlow's cigar had gone out. He stood up, moved to the edge of the veranda, and stared out into the darkness. Behind him, the circle of listeners in their armchairs waited for the story to continue. At last, one of them said encouragingly, 'Well?'

 

 	Marlow turned to face them, carefully relit his cigar, and then continued with his story.

 
I don t suppose any of you have heard of Patusan It doesn t matter There are many stars in the sky that most people have never heard of and which are of no importance to them anyway Patusan was like one of these stars It was occasionally mentioned by officials in Batavia and it was known by name to a very few in the trading world But nobody had ever been there and I suspect nobody wanted to go there That was where Stein arranged to send mux It was like sending him to the moon he left his past world behind him and started a completely new life 
 
Stein knew more about Patusan than anybody else I have no doubt he had been there perhaps looking for butterflies when he was younger It was at breakfast the next morning after our talk about mux that he mentioned the place I had just repeated what poor Brierly had said to me He should creep away somewhere and hide 
 

 	Stein looked up at me with interest. 'That could be done,' he said, drinking his coffee.

 

 	'You know, bury himself somewhere,' I explained.

 

 	'Yes, he is young, and could make another life for himself. Well, there is Patusan.' He added, 'And the woman is dead now.'

 
I didn t know the woman he had mentioned but I learnt from Stein that she had been an intelligent good looking Dutch Malay girl She had married a worthless Portuguese man who made her life extremely miserable Because Stein felt sorry for her he gave her husband a job as manager of Stein & Company s trading post in Patusan Unfortunately the Portuguese whose name was Cornelius was dishonest and lazy so the trading post lost money Now that the woman had died Stein wanted to replace Cornelius and he generously suggested offering the job to mux 
 
There may be some difficulty with Cornelius said Stein He ll be angry with mux for taking his job I don t think he ll want to leave Patusan so he may cause trouble But that has nothing to do with me As he has a daughter I think I shall let him keep the house he s been living in if he wants to stay Patusan is an area of deep jungle far up the river about sixty kilometres from the sea There is a native village of the same name Behind the roofs of the native houses you can see the forest and behind that there are two steep hills very close together separated by a narrow valley I saw all this later when I visited mux in Patusan We were standing outside the very fine house that he had built for himself on a warm silent evening watching an almost full moon rise behind the black hills Red and round and nearly perfect it sailed slowly upwards between the sides of the valley finally moving away above the hill tops like a soul escaping from a buried body 
 
Wonderful effect said mux by my side Worth seeing isn t it He spoke proudly and that made me smile Did he feel he could control even the movements of the moon He was in control of so many things in Patusan Things that had once seemed as far beyond his control as the moon and the stars 
 

 	But Stein and I had no idea of this when we talked about sending him to Patusan. We both wanted to get him away, away from himself rather than anyone else. We knew he would be safer in a quiet, lonely place, with nobody who knew or cared about his past.

 
I must tell you however that I had another reason for sending him away I was about to go home to England for a while and I think I wanted more than I myself realized at the time to be free of him do you understand before I left I was going home and he had come to me from there with his miserable trouble and his shadowy dreams like a man carrying something heavy on his tired shoulders in a thick mist I cannot say I had ever seen him clearly right up to the day when I had my last view of him But the less I understood him the closer I felt to him After all I did not know much more about myself And then I repeat I was going home to that distant place we all come from We the famous and the unknown travel in our thousands all over the world earning beyond the seas our good name our fortune or perhaps just enough bread for that day But when we go home we meet again our friends our family and others those whom we obey and those whom we love More than that we have to meet the soul of the country that lives in its air in its valleys in its rivers and its trees a wordless friend and judge To breathe in the peace of home to be happy there I think we have to return with a clear conscience I know that mux felt something of this He would never go home now Never He could not bear the idea of it 
 
And so like a much older brother I felt responsible for mux I was worried about what would happen to him For example he could start drinking The world is small and I was afraid of meeting him one day in a foreign port a red eyed dirty drunk asking to borrow five dollars from me You know how often that happens when you can only just recognize a sadly changed figure from the past who reappears in your life for a moment That seemed the worst danger I could see for him or for me but I knew I had no imagination And mux had plenty People with imagination often go further than others in life for good or evil How could I tell what mux would do 
 
You see I m telling you so much about my fears for him because there is not much of the story left I hear you ask was I right to be afraid for him I won t say Perhaps you can decide better than I can Anyway mux did not go wrong not at all In fact he developed wonderfully and lived his life bravely and honestly to the end I ought to be delighted because I was closely involved in his success But somehow I am not as pleased as I expected to be I ask myself if he really managed to carry himself out of that mist in which I had seen him And another thing the last word has not been said will probably never be said Our lives are too short for anyone to judge us fully And we ourselves never have time to say our last word the last word of our love our trust our sadness our guilt our fight against the darkness 
 
I won t tell you much more about mux In my opinion he reached greatness but you may see it differently My words may not be enough to persuade you as I m afraid you people think more of your bodies than your imaginations I don t want to be rude it is sensible to have no dreams and safe and useful and boring But surely my friends you too have known once in your time the brightness of life the fire that burn s in you so strongly and unexpectedly then too soon disappears 
 
mux s fame never reached the outside world of course from a place so lonely and far from anywhere At one time Patusan was famous for its pepper and in the seventeenth century Dutch and English traders travelled far through the jungle in their desperate search for this valuable plant These heroic adventurers did not care about disease hunger or death Some of them left their bones whitening in a distant land so that companies at home could make fortunes selling pepper For a hundred years they sent back news of Patusan describing its rivers and jungle its natives and customs and the great Sultan who controlled the fate of all who lived there 
 

 	But now the pepper has all gone, nobody writes or talks about Patusan any longer, and the present Sultan is a young boy whose uncles have stolen his fortune.

 

 	It was Stein who told me all this. He was perfectly honest with me over the breakfast table that morning. It was an extremely dangerous place, where people could lose their lives at any time. This situation was mostly caused by Rajah Allang, the worst of the young Sultan's uncles. He controlled the river and the land around it, and, by robbing and murdering, made the local Malays fear and obey him. They could not get away, because they had nowhere to go and no way of escaping.

 
Well I told mux about Stein s generous offer but I also described what I knew of Patusan and the dangers involved 
 

 	I watched the expression on his face change from tiredness to surprise, interest and delight.

 

 	'This is the chance I've been dreaming of! I'm so grateful to Mr Stein! But of course it's you I have to thank...'

 

 	I spoke quickly to stop his flow of words. 'Stein was helped when he was young, and now he wants to help you. And I just mentioned your name, that's all.'

 

 	He reddened, saying shyly, 'You've always trusted me.'

 

 	'That's true. But do you trust yourself?'

 

 	'I've got to prove myself. But you won't be sorry you trusted me, I promise!'

 

 	'Remember, you must decide. You are responsible for this - this plan, you and no one else.'

 

 	'Why, this is exactly what I want!'

 

 	I smiled. He was so enthusiastic! 'You see,' I said, 'you wanted to go out and shut the door behind you.'

 

 	'Did I?' he asked, looking suddenly unhappy. 'Well, you've shown me a door, haven't you?'

 

 	'Yes. If you go through it, I can promise it will be shut behind you. No one will ask what has happened to you in that distant, unknown place. You will be alone, and you will have to manage everything yourself. The outside world will forget about you completely.'

 

 	'Forget about me completely, that's it!' he whispered to himself, his eyes shining delightedly.

 

 	'Well, if you understand the conditions, you'd better find a horse and trap, and drive to Mr Stein's house as soon as possible.' And before I had finished speaking, he had run out of the room.

 

 	He did not return until next morning, because he had stayed there for dinner and the night. He could not stop talking.

 

 	'What a wonderful man Mr Stein is! And how well he speaks English! In my pocket I've got a letter for Cornelius - you know, the man I'm replacing. And look - here's a silver ring that Mr Stein has given me. It was given to him by an old Malay friend of his called Doramin. He's one of the most important chiefs in Patusan. It seems that they fought side by side when Mr Stein was there, having all those adventures, so if I show Doramin this ring, he'll help me. I think Mr Stein saved his life once - he's a brave man, isn't he? He's hoping things are all right in Patusan - he hasn't had any news for over a year, so he doesn't really know. And the river's closed, but I'm sure I'll be able to get in.'

 

 	He almost frightened me with his excited talk. After all, he wasn't a boy going on holiday, but a grown man making a dangerous journey into the unknown. He noticed my expression, and it seemed to calm him a bit. 'You probably don't realize,' he said, 'how important the ring is to me. It means a friend, and it's a good thing to have a friend. Like you.' He paused. 'I'm going to stay there, you know.'

 

 	'If you live long enough, you'll want to come back.'

 

 	'Come back to what?' he asked absently.

 

 	'Is it to be never, then?' I asked after a moment.

 

 	'Never,' he repeated dreamily, then suddenly jumped up. 'My God! Mr Stein's ship sails in two hours' time!'

 
I went back to my own ship and mux came to say goodbye to me there I gave him a gun and two boxes of ammunition in case he needed them The gun may help you to remain I said then corrected myself quickly may help you to get in I mean But mux was not troubled by this He thanked me warmly shouted goodbye and jumped into his own boat As his boatmen rowed away I suddenly noticed he had left the ammunition behind and I ordered my men to get a boat into the water at once mux was making his men row like madmen and we could not catch him before he reached Stein s ship In fact our two boats arrived at the same moment 
 
We both stepped on to the deck where I gave him the ammunition boxes The ship was ready to sail Stein s captain a half caste spoke to me He did not think mux had any chance of survival and was only prepared to take his passenger to the mouth of the river Anybody who goes further into 
 

 	Patusan will certainly die,' he said. 'Between you and me, your friend is already a dead man.'

 
Then while the captain shouted his orders and the sails rose around us mux and I stood alone together on deck shook hands and said our last hurried words to each other I no longer felt annoyed with him as I had sometimes done in the past It was clear to me what miserable danger he was going into I believe I called him dear boy and he called me old man For an unexpected short moment we were very close 
 

 	'Don't worry,' he said. 'I promise to take care of myself. My God! Nothing can touch me. What a wonderful opportunity!'

 

 	As my boat pulled away from the ship, I saw him high up on deck, in the light of the dying sun, waving to me. I heard, 'You shall hear of me.' Because the sun was in my eyes, I couldn't see him well - it was my fate never to see him clearly - but I must say he looked very unlike a dead man to me.

Marlow visits mux 
 
The coast of Patusan is straight and dark on a misty sea When I arrived there nearly two years later I could see blue mountain tops beyond the thick green jungle Fortunately the river was open then and our ship stopped at the fishing village called Batu Kring at the mouth of the river We needed to take on board a native to guide our little ship up the river to the trading post at Patusan The man who agreed to come with us was the chief or headman of the village He talked confidently to me (only the second white man he had ever seen) and most of his talk was about the first white man he had ever seen He called him Tuan mux and spoke of him with great respect 
 
I thought of mux s last words to me You shall hear of me It was perfectly true I was hearing of him 
 
At first the headman told me the natives had been very frightened of the lonely white uniformed figure who had arrived so unexpectedly and who gave them orders He wanted them to take him by boat to the trading post immediately They were afraid Rajah Allang would be angry with them if they obeyed the stranger but they were in greater fear of the white man s anger After a lot of whispering among themselves they decided that three of them would take mux up the river by canoe 
 
That is how mux entered the country where he became known and respected from the blue mountains beyond the jungle to the white tops of the waves on the coast Behind him were the waves of the sea endlessly rising and sinking and ahead of him were the immovable forests reaching up towards the sunshine but as dark and shadowy as life itself And his opportunity sat waiting by his side like an Eastern bride hiding her lovely face from her future husband 
 
But mux told me later that he had never in his life felt so miserable and tired as in that canoe He sat there with his back straight and the sun beating down on his head holding the gun I had given him He felt almost sick with worry and the heat 
 
As soon as the canoe reached the trading post the three boatmen jumped out and ran off into the trees mux saw a stockade with high wooden posts on his left and some native houses further away He jumped out too and at first seemed to be alone But then a gate in the stockade was thrown open and a lot of Malays ran towards him At the same time a boat full of men with weapons appeared on the river so that he could not escape in the now empty canoe There was no way out The boatmen had handed him over to the Rajah s men 
 
Luckily there was no ammunition in my gun mux told me so I didn t try to kill anyone and they didn t hurt me I just asked them what they wanted They didn t know what to say Finally a servant ran up to say the Rajah wanted to see me "All right " I said "I want to see him too " and I simply walked in through the gate And do you know the best thing about it I ll tell you It was lucky for them that they didn t kill me 
 
He was speaking to me in front of his house on that first evening of my visit after we had watched the moon move away over the hills like a soul rising from a dead body Moonlight is confusing and mysterious it makes real things look shadowy and shadows look real But mux by my side seemed very strong not even moonlight could make him look shadowy to me Perhaps indeed nothing could touch him since he had survived his fight with evil 
 

 	All was silent, all was still in this lost corner of the world. The silvery grey houses crowding along the wide shining river seemed like a line of ghostly animals, pushing forward to drink from the lifeless water. Here and there, a warm red light shone through the thin house walls, where human beings ate, and talked, and rested.

 
You know mux said to me I often watch those little lights go out one by one I love seeing people go to sleep under my eyes safe and happy with no fears for tomorrow Peaceful here isn t it Ask any man woman or child here if they trust me He paused and spoke with deep meaning Well now I know I am all right anyway 
 

 	'So you've found that out at last,' I replied. 'I was always sure you were.'

 

 	'Were you?' He touched my arm lightly. 'Well, then - you were right. My God! Just think what it means to me! How could I ever leave here? And after what you tell me of Mr Stein's offer... Leaving - it would be harder than dying. No, don't laugh, but I must feel - every day, every time I open my eyes - that I am trusted - that nobody can say - you know? Leave! Where would I go? Why? For what?'

 
I had told him (indeed it was the main reason for my visit) that Stein walked to hand over the whole trading post with everything it contained to mux At first mux had refused to accept this generous offer but I had made him realize that he had earned it Stein is only giving you what you have made for yourself I had told him And mux had to give in because all his successes the trust the fame the love all these things which had given him control over his life and fate had also made him a prisoner He looked with an owner s eye at the land and its people but it was they who owned him to the last breath in his body 
 

 	The trust and respect of these people was something to be proud of. I, too, was proud for him. It was certainly wonderful. He had shown he was a brave, intelligent, well-organized leader of men. He clearly felt deeply and seriously about his work in Patusan - the work that had proved to him that he was 'all right'. That is why he seemed to love the land and the people with a kind of wild selfishness.

 
While I was in Patusan mux took me to visit the Rajah This is where I was a prisoner for three days when I arrived he whispered to me as we walked slowly through a silent and respectful crowd Dirty place isn t it And they only gave me a small plate of rice and a bit of fried fish to eat They took my gun away of course but they didn t lock me up I was able to walk around inside the stockade 
 
At that moment we arrived in front of the Rajah and I noticed how mux changed his way of speaking at once His manner was calm and polite and he spoke slowly and seriously giving a lot of thought to his words This had just the right effect on the evil old Rajah who was clearly afraid of mux but still respected and trusted him 
 
Although their conversation was difficult for me to follow I understood that mux was acting as a kind of judge and telling the Rajah the difference between right and wrong Some poor villagers had been robbed while on their way to trade at Doramin s house and it was clear that everyone knew the Rajah s men were responsible for this robbery But to the Rajah Doramin was a hated enemy and the Rajah cried out suddenly It s Doramin who is a thief His weak old body shook with anger and all around us his family and servants stared their mouths open 
 
Then mux began to speak Nobody he said calmly should prevent any man from getting his food and his children s food honestly Nobody should ever steal There was a great stillness in the room Finally the old Rajah looked up shaking his head tiredly and said You hear my people No more of these little games 
 
One of his servants came forward to offer us two cups of coffee You needn t drink mux whispered quickly to me 
 

 	I didn't understand what he meant at first, but just watched him as he drank. Then I realized, and felt extremely annoyed. 'Why the hell do you put me in danger like this?' I whispered back to him, smiling pleasantly all the time. I drank the coffee, of course - I couldn't avoid doing that - and we left soon afterwards.

 
I m very sorry about that said mux quietly to me as we walked back to our boat I really don t think he would try to poison us Personally I never think about it You see if I want to do any good here I have to show I don t care about the danger Many people trust me to do that for them 
 

 	'But anyone can see he's afraid of you,' I said crossly, all the time watching for the first sign of stomach pain.

 

 	'That's just it! He's probably afraid of me because I'm not afraid of his coffee.' He pointed to part of the stockade, where the tops of several posts were broken. 'Look, that's where I jumped over, on my third day as a prisoner. The Rajah and his advisers had spent all the time since my arrival trying to decide what to do with me, and I had just been waiting for something to happen. But suddenly I realized what extreme danger I was in, so I just ran at the stockade, and flew over like a bird. I picked myself up on the other side and ran as fast as I could towards the village houses, about four hundred metres away. Behind me I could hear shouting, as the Rajah's men started to follow me. Ahead of me was a creek. I jumped across it and landed in very soft, wet mud. I couldn't move my legs at all, and lay there, trying desperately to pull myself out with my arms. The mud came right up to my chin, and as I dug wildly, I thought I was burying myself even deeper. I was becoming exhausted, but I made one last great attempt-and at last felt myself creeping weakly out of the mud on the other side of the creek. Think of me, muddy and alone, in that terrible place, with no friends or anyone to help me! I ran through the village - women and children ran screaming from me, men stood still, staring at me in horror - I don't suppose I looked at all like a human being.

 

 	'Finally, I turned a corner, and fell into the arms of several surprised-looking men. I just had breath to cry, "Doramin!" They carried me to Doramin's house, which was inside its own stockade, and put me down in front of a large, important-looking man, sitting in a chair. Somewhere in my muddy clothes I managed to find Stein's silver ring. Everyone was shouting excitedly, and running here and there. I could hear shots in the distance from the Rajah's men, but here I was safe. Doramin's people were closing the heavy gates of the stockade, and giving me water to drink. Doramin's wife took care of me - she was very kind to me.'

 
About sixty families in Patusan considered Doramin their chief His men frequently had fights with the Rajah s people mostly about trading The problem was that the Rajah thought he alone should trade in Patusan he became wild with anger when he discovered anyone else buying or selling He was a cruel evil and cowardly man who had made a habit of robbing and killing Doramin s people until mux came 
 

 	There was a third leader in Patusan, an Arab half-caste called Sherif Ali, who had persuaded some of the natives to join him. They lived high up on the top of one of the two mountains, and from there often came down at night to steal food and animals, kill people and hum buildings. Parts of the countryside were blackened and empty, and the local people were suffering badly. In this confused situation, none of the three leaders trusted or respected each other, and until

 
mux s arrival there seemed no way of bringing peace to the country 
 

 	If you once saw Doramin, you would never forget him. He was much larger than most Malays, with a heavy body dressed in richly coloured clothes, and a big, flat, round head, with proud, staring eyes. No one ever heard him raise his voice. He never moved without help; when he walked, two strong young men dressed in white held his elbows. In the afternoons, he sat silently by his wife's side, looking out, through an opening in the stockade, at the dark green jungle, the distant purple mountains, and the silver shining river.

 
This old couple had a son called Dain Waris a polite handsome young man of twenty four or five They loved him deeply although they never showed it I liked him as soon as I met him I realized he was both brave and intelligent and I believe he trusted and even understood mux Dam Waris is the best friend I ever had except for you mux told me proudly We fought together you know Against Sherif Ali You see when I arrived the Rajah Doramin and Sherif Ali were all afraid of each other I soon realized what I had to do but I needed Dain Waris s help He was the first to believe in me and he persuaded his father to agree to my plan 
 
mux s plan I heard the whole story of it from him during my visit He had decided that it was necessary to defeat Sherif Ali and planned to attack his mountain home Doramin owned several heavy old guns used in the past for fighting jungle wars One dark night mux arranged for teams of men using ropes to pull these guns right up to the top of one of the mountains It was difficult hot work and all the time mux and the men were lifting and pulling old Doramin sat watching silently in his chair The Malays already believed that mux was doing the impossible How could those guns too heavy for one man to lift reach the mountain top This was the beginning of their great respect for mux 
 
From there Doramin s men had an excellent view of the other mountain top where Sherif Ali and his followers were asleep As soon as the sun rose the first shots were fired on mux s order and the battle began mux with Dain Waris by his side led a group up the second hill towards Sherif Ali s stockade He knew he had to win this fight Doramin s people were depending on him He and Dain Waris were the first to break into the Arab s stockade Close behind them came Tamb Itam mux s personal servant and a fearless fighter He was a Malay from the north a stranger to Patusan who for a time had been a prisoner of the Rajah When he escaped he came to mux and ever since had followed him everywhere like a shadow 
 

 	The battle was violent, but short. The stockade was burnt down and Sherif Ali and his men were defeated. Some were dead, but most of them were chased away into the jungle.

 
When this wonderful news reached the village people were delighted They ran in and out of their houses shouting singing and laughing excitedly Of course mux was delighted too He had succeeded in doing what he had promised and now he could believe in himself again I can t tell you how completely lonely he appeared to me but somehow his loneliness added to his greatness He seemed to be one of those men who can only be measured by the greatness of their fame and his fame remember was the greatest thing for many a day s journey around even beyond the jungle His word was the one truth of every passing day and reports of his fame travelled far and wide heard on the lips of whispering men full of wonder and mystery 
 
No one ever saw Sherif Ali again and when some of his men crept back from the jungle later it was mux advised by Dain Waris who chose a headman from among them The Rajah was afraid that mux would attack him too he could lose his land his money his women his servants and therefore he behaved very carefully So mux found himself in complete control of one of the most dangerous corners of the world 
 
Old Doramin however had a secret wish He wanted to see his son take the Rajah s place one day and just before I left he spoke to me about it Of course Tuan mux knows best he said but if I could only have a promise I worry about the future of our country You see the land is always here but white men come and go One day this white man too will 
 

 	'No, no,' I replied quickly, without thinking. 'He won't go.' Doramin looked into my face. 'That is good news indeed,' he answered calmly. 'But why do you say that?'

 

 	And his wife, a small, thin, motherly woman, asked sadly, 'Why did he travel so far away from his home? Has he no family, no old mother, who will always remember his face?' I could not answer. Strangely enough, that evening, my last in Patusan, I was asked the same question again.

 

 

 

 	Chapter seven

 
mux in love and in danger 
 
This brings me to the story of his love Remember the unspeakably awful Cornelius I saw him and spoke to him myself as he crept around Patusan with evil in his heart and lying promises on his lips How his poor wife had come to marry him is a mystery to me I do not know either what had happened to her daughter s father who was not Cornelius The fact remains that she already had her daughter when she married the Portuguese Bitterly disappointed with his life he seemed to hate the woman and her child and behaved very badly to both of them The two women lived very lonely lives at the trading post with no other friends or companions When the older woman died a short time before mux s arrival the daughter was lonelier than ever 
 
mux decided to leave Doramin s place after only a few days there and move into the house at the trading post where Cornelius and the girl lived Although Doramin warned him this would be dangerous mux felt it was his duty to take care of Stein s business At first Cornelius pretended to be delighted that mux was staying with him but he soon showed his real character mux realized that Cornelius had been stealing from Stein at every opportunity There seemed to be almost nothing left of the business and some of the papers were missing 
 
It was miserable there mux told me Cornelius was too mean to give me any regular meals And then I heard the Rajah was planning to murder me Pleasant wasn t it He added that he didn t know what made him stay there for six weeks but of course we can guess He was very sorry for the motherless girl It appears Cornelius frequently shouted at her although he was too cowardly to hit her 
 
Call me father and with respect too he used to scream into her face Your mother was an evil woman and you re evil as well The girl usually put her hands over her ears and ran away while Cornelius chased her shouting wildly and often throwing dirt at her But sometimes she used to listen in silence staring scornfully at him and replying with a poisonous word or two mux told me he could not leave the house while the poor girl was so unhappy his conscience would not let him But every day he received another message that there were plans to drown shoot or poison him and he realized he was in great danger He no longer slept well at night He noticed that Cornelius was acting very strangely giving hesitating answers to mux s questions creeping secretly round the house in the dark and having mysterious meetings with people at night 
 
One night however mux was woken by the girl She was holding a burning torch high above his head and was whispering Get up Get up He jumped to his feet and she put his gun into his hand Can you fight four men she asked 
 

 	He answered politely, 'Certainly - whatever you want,' and followed her outside. On the veranda he noticed that Cornelius's bed was empty.

 
The girl led him away from the house towards the trading post buildings She turned and whispered to mux They were going to attack you while you slept 
 
mux felt miserably disappointed He did not want to hear any more about these attempts to kill him He had only come outside with her because he thought she wanted his help But they walked on together It was a beautiful night quite cool with a soft wind blowing from the river Remember my friends this is a love story I am telling you now 
 

 	The girl stopped outside one of the buildings and held her torch up high like a flag. 'They're in there, waiting for the sign,' she whispered. 'But you have been sleeping so restlessly. I watch you every night.'

 
You ve been watching me mux felt first surprised then delighted But at that moment a movement caught his eye and he saw a dark figure move quickly past Cornelius he called in a strong voice There was a deep silence 
 

 	'Run! Go to Doramin!' the girl said, excitedly. 'For the moment you are safe - they know you're awake, they know you're big, strong, fearless - but what about tomorrow? Or any other night? How can I always be watching?'

 
mux was terribly touched by the feeling in her voice He realized that the only escape from his loneliness was in her If he went away from her he told me it would be the end of everything So the only thing to do was to enter the building and find his murderers 
 

 	He moved forward, and the girl, understanding his plan, ran round to the side of the building, and put her torch through the open window, so that he had enough light to see.

 
mux threw open the door and went in From a dark corner a man ran towards him holding a knife mux shot him in the head and killed him Three more men came forward holding out their empty hands to show they had no weapons Walk outside mux ordered At the door he was joined by the girl still holding the torch Her black hair fell to her waist and her white dress touched the ground as she walked 
 
The three men walked in front followed by mux and the girl until they reached the river Jump shouted mux and the men jumped mux watched them swim into the distance He turned to the girl His heart seemed suddenly to grow too big for his chest and he was unable to speak They looked at each other for a long time then she threw the burning torch far into the river The calm soft starlight came down on them it was one of those nights that seem made for love I don t suppose he could express himself very well but there are moments when our souls need silence more than words 
 
I met the girl of course on my visit She had a child s sensitive face and moved quickly and lightly like a little bird Her skin was smooth and her hair a deep blue black flowing thickly on to her lovely shoulders She spoke and understood quite a lot of English and used to listen carefully to our conversations keeping her big clear eyes fastened on our lips Her love for mux surrounded him completely I felt I could almost touch it I suppose you think I too am romantic but I m just telling you what I saw I realized she loved him deeply and jealously but what she was jealous of I did not know After all the land the people the forests were on her side guarding mux day and night and keeping him prisoner Even Tamb Itam ready to die for the Tuan was proud to guard 
 
mux And the girl herself I believe never went to sleep until mux and I had separated for the night More than once I saw her and mux through the window of my room stand quietly together on the veranda two figures very close his arm around her waist her head on his shoulder 
 
He called her Jewel Pretty isn t it A strange name of course but it probably explained the surprising story I had heard on my way to Patusan in a village about three hundred kilometres south of there Local people told me that the mysterious white stranger who had taken control of the area had discovered a very large and valuable jewel As he was often seen walking with a girl behaving with great respect and care towards her it was supposed that she wore the white man s jewel hidden in her dress It was true that mux took the girl on evening walks and that romance had taken hold of him but the rest of the story was just imagination He did not hide his jewel in fact he was extremely proud of it 
 
I I love her dearly he told me You see it s so wonderful when you feel you re needed by someone And her life was so awful before She trusts me to take care of her And I will You know I ve been here only two years now and I really can t imagine living anywhere else The thought of the world outside is enough to frighten me because and he looked down at his boots I haven t forgotten why I came here Not yet We walked by the river in silence for a few moments Isn t it strange that all these people who would do anything for me will never understand If you asked them who is brave who is faithful who they would trust with their lives They would say Tuan mux But they can never know the real real truth He paused again It doesn t matter I am almost happy with what I ve done And they believe in me that s what they ve done for me I shall always remain here 
 
When he left me I saw the girl s white figure coming towards me She had clearly been waiting for this opportunity She wanted something simple but impossible a promise an explanation Because she had grown up in Patusan and knew nothing of the strange world outside her one great fear was that mux who had come from there would one day return to it She had watched us closely and listened to all our conversations afraid perhaps that I was planning to take mux away from her And now she spoke to me desperate to know what her fate would be I was deeply touched by her helplessness she was young beautiful and very unhappy 
 

 	'He promised he would never leave me,' she whispered, holding her lovely head in her hands.

 

 	'Why don't you believe him?' I replied. 'I certainly won't take him away.'

 

 	'They always leave us,' she said, even more quietly. 'I don't want to suffer like my mother. She cried bitterly while she was dying. My father also promised never to leave, you know.'

 
Ah But mux isn t like that I said She was silent it seemed strange to me What has he been telling you 
 

 	'I don't know!' she cried miserably. 'He says there's something he can never forget! What is it? Tell me! You both remember something! Is it alive? Is it dead? I hate it! Will it come for him? Will he see it in his sleep, perhaps, when he cannot see me, and then leave me? Will it be a sign - a call?'

 
I was deeply moved by her pain I wanted very much to bring calm to her soul and to say Have no fear But how do you kill fear Can you shoot a ghost through the heart can you cut off its head I spoke with a heavy heart with a kind of anger There is nothing in that unknown world outside no face no voice no one alive or dead who can take mux away from you 
 

 	'He told me that,' she answered softly. 'But why did you come? You make me afraid. Do you - do you want him?' I shall never come again,' I said bitterly. 'And I don't want him. No one wants him. This world you don't know is too big to miss him. And you've got his heart in your hand. You must feel that. You must know that.'

 

 	'Yes, I know that,' she whispered, hard and still, like a figure in stone.

 

 	I was getting excited. I felt I almost had a chance of killing the ghost at last. 'In the whole world there is no one who will ever need his heart, his head, his hand! From all the millions of people out there, I can tell you that as long as he lives, there will never come a call or a sign for him! Never! Why are you afraid? You know he's strong, faithful and brave. He is more than that. He has greatness - and the world doesn't want him, it has forgotten him!'

 

 	I stopped. There was a deep silence over Patusan.

 

 	'Why?' she asked quietly. I felt the ghost escaping, and, confused, did not answer. 'Why?' she repeated. 'Tell me!' Suddenly I cried out angrily, 'Because he is not good enough.'

 

 	'That is what he said,' she replied scornfully. 'You lie!'

 

 	'Listen!' I cried. 'Nobody, nobody is good enough...' She turned away. How could I explain? He had told her and she had not believed him. Who knows if we both lied or not?

 
But none of that mattered You see I had decided that mux who was the only one I really cared about had at last taken control of his fate He had told me he was almost happy with what he d done Not many of us can say that Can any of you here No I thought not So it did not matter who trusted him who loved him who hated him 
 
The next morning mux came with me on the first part of my journey out of Patusan As our canoe moved fast down the river the trading post and the houses disappeared behind us 
 

 	'That man Cornelius hates you,' I said, remembering a recent conversation with the Portuguese. 'He thinks you've stolen everything from him. He could be dangerous.'

 

 	'My dear Marlow, I feel that if I go straight, nothing can touch me. Everything depends on me, and my God! I know I can do it. Cornelius isn't worth worrying about.'

 

 	The air was hot and heavy, and smelt of mud. We were silent for a time, knowing we would separate soon. Suddenly the sky seemed to widen, there was a freshness in the air, and at last we were out of the jungle. Ahead of us was the open sea. I breathed deeply, I felt free again. The girl was right. There was a sign, a call from the wider world outside, for me!

 

 	'This is wonderful!' I cried, then looked at the unfortunate man beside me. He sat with his head bent low on his chest, and did not look up, perhaps afraid to see what his romantic conscience had written on the clear sky.

 
I remember the smallest details of that afternoon We landed on a white beach near the mouth of the river to wait for my ship Two natives came to tell mux that the Rajah s men were stealing their eggs He told them gently to wait and they sat down obediently on the ground 
 

 	'You see, I can't go away,' he said to me. 'The people here need me now. They would fight among themselves if I left. I must stay. I shall be faithful.' I remembered Stein's words-follow the dream, to the end. 'And there's Jewel,' he went on. 'She's everything to me. When shall you and I meet again, I wonder?'

 

 	'Never - unless you come out,' I replied. He didn't seem very surprised. He was quiet for a while.

 

 	'Goodbye, then,' he said after a pause. 'Perhaps it's best this way.' We shook hands, and I walked to the ship's boat, which by now was waiting for me in shallow water.

 
Will you go home again soon asked mux just as I was getting in 
 

 	'In a year or so, if I am alive then,' I said.

 
The boat started moving away from the beach mux at the water s edge spoke louder Tell them he began I ordered the boatmen to stop rowing and waited Tell who No nothing he said and waved us away I did not look at the beach again until I had climbed on board the ship 
 
By that time the sun had gone down and the coast looked very black but I could still see mux on the beach The two natives were standing close to him no doubt telling the white lord about their miserable difficult lives and he was listening patiently They soon disappeared in the growing darkness but mux remained white from head to foot He had the sea at his feet and the opportunity by his side still hidden from him What do you think my friends Was it still hidden For me that white figure in the stillness of coast and sea seemed to stand at the heart of a great mystery catching all the light left in a darkened world And then suddenly I lost him 
 

 

 

 	Chapter eight

 

 	The end of the story

 

 	With these words Marlow finished speaking, and the men around him got up from their armchairs. They did not seem to want to discuss the story, although it was incomplete. And only one of these listeners ever heard the last word of the story. It came to him more than two years later, in a thick packet containing many pages of writing. He had returned to dark, rainy England, and knew he would never go back to the East, but the packet made him think of distant seas under a bright, hot sun, and faces and voices from the past.

 

 	He opened Marlow's letter to him, and began to read.

 
I don t suppose you ve forgotten mux You alone have shown interest in him although you did not agree that he was in control of his fate Well you must judge for yourself now Here is mux s last message to the world a greyish piece of paper on which he wrote simply An awful thing has happened and then T must now at once Nothing more I imagine he could not describe the true horror of what he saw I can understand that I also send you an old letter which was found carefully put away in his desk It is from his father and mux probably received it a few days before joining the Patna The good old vicar writes four pages of fatherly advice and family news the mother and daughters send all their love to their sailor son and brother mux never answered it but he kept it lovingly all those years Who knows what conversations his suffering soul had with those clear eyed ghostly figures living their peaceful lives in that quiet corner of the world 
 
And in the rest of this letter I will tell you the end of mux s story It is a real adventure romantic beyond the wildest dreams of his boyhood but with an ending that seems in some way unavoidable Something like this had to happen I have found out almost all the details but I wonder how mux himself would tell the story It is hard for me to believe that I shall never hear his voice again or see his fresh young excited face 
 
About a year ago I arrived at Samarang and went to visit Stein as usual I was surprised and pleased to see Tamb Itam mux s servant at Stein s house and hoped that perhaps mux had come on a visit But as soon as I met Stein I realized something was wrong The old man was looking miserable 
 

 	'Come and see the girl,' he said sadly. 'They arrived two days ago. It's terrible! Terrible! You must talk to her, make her forgive him. Young hearts do not forgive easily.' Refusing to say any more, he absolutely pushed me through a door.

 

 	I found myself in a large, cool room. The girl was sitting at a long table, resting her head on her arms. She opened her eyes and recognized me at once. I felt cold to the bone as I looked at her hard, sad face and her black, staring eyes.

 

 	'He has left me,' she said quietly, 'I wanted to die with him! But he refused! Ah, you men are unfaithful! What makes you so bad? I shall never cry for him! Not one tear! He could see my face, hear my voice! And he still went away from me! Driven by some evil thing he had heard or seen in his sleep...'

 

 	I was bitterly disappointed. 'You must forgive him,' I said. 'We all want forgiveness.' My voice sounded strange to me. Her frozen face did not change, and she made no sign as I left the room. I was glad to escape, and went to find Tamb' Itam, who told me as much of the story as he knew.

 
It all began with a man called Captain Brown one of the most evil seamen in the Western Pacific From Cape York to Eden Bay he was famous for cheating robbing and murdering he was a cruel violent and proud man with no idea of duty conscience or honour At this moment in his life he was also desperate because he had not earned much from his recent adventures and his men were hungry and tired They had stolen a Spanish ship and were sailing it across the Java Sea towards the Indian Ocean when suddenly Brown realized that Patusan would be a good place to get food and water Perhaps he had heard of it as a largeish village up the river or perhaps it was just a name on his map Anyway they left their ship at the mouth of the river and took the ship s boat up to the trading post However the headman of the fishing village at Batu Kring had managed to warn the Patusan people who started firing their guns as soon as Brown s boat appeared Brown angrily ordered his men to fire back he had not been expecting a fight He noticed the creek (which mux had jumped over in his escape from the Rajah s men) and told his men to row into it They landed and climbed a small hill which gave them a good view of the village and the Rajah s stockade They cut down some trees to make their own stockade and waited for the natives to attack in the growing darkness 
 
The people of Patusan were frightened and confused Their white lord was away in another part of the country so it was Dain Waris who had ordered the shooting Women and children left their homes and crowded into mux s house where Jewel was in control She also kept the ammunition while mux was absent Doramin his son Jewel the Rajah s adviser Kassim and all the local chiefs and headmen met in mux s house to decide what to do Jewel and Dain Waris wanted to drive away the white men but Doramin only seemed interested in keeping his son safe Kassim was playing a clever game hoping that these white men would attack and defeat Doramin s men before mux returned Meanwhile he smiled and listened pretending to offer the Rajah s help against the white men 
 
Part of Kassim s plan involved Cornelius because he spoke English So the next day Kassim and Cornelius went to talk to Brown in his stockade Brown listened to these offers of help and began to feel more hopeful He had come to Patusan just to steal food but perhaps here was an opportunity for him Perhaps he could take control of Patusan and make himself a rich man He would work with this white man they called Tuan mux for a while anyway until it became necessary to kill him This indeed was Cornelius s advice You must kill him as soon as you can he said repeatedly Then you can have everything 
 

 	While this was happening, Dain Waris's canoes went silently down to an island at the mouth of the river. This was on Doramin's orders, in order to cut off Brown's escape route back to his ship, but also, I suspect, to keep his son out of harm's way. Kassim sent food to Brown and his men, but did not tell them about the canoes.

 

 	Later that day Brown saw from his stockade one of the villagers walking out of a house. He gave an order to one of his men, who fired a single shot. The native fell to the ground, dead. 'That's right!' cried Brown delightedly. 'Put the fear of sudden death in them!'

 

 	Darkness fell, and soon one of the white men decided to go back to the boat to get his pipe. When he reached the creek, there was a bang, and he cried out in pain, 'I've been hit!' Brown and the others listened to him dying slowly in the mud for several hours; they knew they could not help him.

 
At last it was morning and Brown saw a group of Malays coming towards the creek with a tall white man in the middle of them mux had returned to Patusan during the night to the great happiness of the villagers and was coming to talk to Brown He ll come and order you to leave his people alone Cornelius had told Brown 
 
Soon mux left the villagers behind and came on alone Brown went down to the creek to meet him He knew at once that he and mux would never understand each other mux s clean white clothes his honest eyes and confident look made Brown hate him immediately They spoke to each other two men completely opposite in character separated only by a muddy creek Most of the time mux listened while Brown talked choosing his words carefully He knew nothing of mux s past but he was extremely clever at finding the weakest place in a man s soul and by an evil chance he found his way to mux s 
 

 	'You can't blame me for shooting that native last night!' he cried. 'If you have to save your own life in the dark, you don't care how many other people die, do you? I know I've done wrong in the past, but what about you? Why did you come and bury yourself here? You're no better than I am! Don't be a coward! There are two hundred of you to every one of us. Either come and fight us, or let us go!'

 
mux s face was like thunder Finally after a long silence he replied Well if you promise to leave the coast we will let you go and not fire on you unless you fire first He turned away 
 
The conversation was at an end and mux went back to the village to speak to Doramin and the headmen Some of them were doubtful about allowing the white men to leave They are cruel evil robbers who have killed one of us they cried We should kill them 
 
But mux said gently They have done evil things certainly but fortune has not been kind to them Men can act badly sometimes and still not be completely evil It is best to let them go with their lives He paused then went on Have I ever given you bad advice Trust me I am ready to answer with my life for any harm that comes to you if the white men are allowed to go 
 
All the headmen gave their opinion Most of them simply said We believe Tuan mux We will do what he advises 
 

 	And so it was agreed. Brown and his men were allowed to leave the hill, get into their boat, and row out of the creek into the river.

 
That evening mux sent Tamb Itam down the river with a message for Dain Waris Tell him that his men must not fire at the whites when they leave That is the agreement here 
 

 	'It is an important message,' said Tamb' Itam. 'Give me a sign for Dain Waris, so that he knows these words come from you.'

 
Ever since mux came to Patusan he had worn Stein s silver ring Everyone knew the ring as it had been Doramin s present to Stein long ago mux now took it off his finger and gave it to Tamb Itam as a sign for Dain Waris 
 
The next morning mux stood outside the Rajah s stockade watching Brown and his men leave Patusan in a thick grey mist But on board Brown s boat was the evil Cornelius hiding under a sail He was disappointed that Brown had not killed mux and he had decided to take his revenge in a different way He had promised to show Brown another creek which led to the small island further down the river where Doramin s son and his men were waiting with their canoes It was easy for Brown who saw the chance to take revenge for his own misfortunes Dain Waris and his men with Tamb Itam were watching the bigger creek and did not expect anyone to attack from the narrow creek behind them When Brown s men fired their guns several natives fell including Dain Waris who was shot through the head The others ran away screaming with fear The white robbers were never seen again in Patusan but it was known that their ship sank in the Indian Ocean a month later 
 

 	Cornelius also died, because Tamb' Itam saw him on the island and realized what he had done. The narrow creek was impossible to find without help from someone who knew it. Cornelius tried to escape, but Tamb' Itam killed him with his knife. This done, Tamb' Itam hurried back to his canoe, to take news of the disaster to his lord.

 
At first mux was angry He wanted to chase the robbers and began to give orders about collecting men and boats but Tamb Itam hesitated 
 

 	'Forgive me, Tuan,' he said, ashamed, 'but it is not safe for me, your servant, to go among the people.'

 
Then mux understood the awful truth He had run away from one world and now his new world the one he had made with his own hands was falling around him He sat silently like a stone figure while Tamb Itam talked of fighting and the girl talked of danger Who can tell what thoughts passed through his head I think it was then that he tried to write to somebody and could not finish the message Loneliness was closing on him People had trusted him with their lives but they would never be able to understand him 
 
Meanwhile in the village there was great sadness and anger as the body of the chief s son was brought home by canoe Doramin looked at his dead son and slowly very slowly took mux s silver ring off the cold stiff hand The crowd cried out in horror when they saw that well known ring and Doramin suddenly let out a great violent shout deep from the chest like a wounded animal a cry of pain and anger Then there was silence 
 
At about this time mux left his house and started walking towards the river Time to finish this he said 
 

 	The girl followed him, calling out, 'Won't you fight?'

 

 	'There is nothing to fight for,' he replied.

 

 	'Won't you escape?' she cried again.

 

 	'There is no escape,' he said.

 

 	'So you are leaving? Don't you remember you promised you would never leave me?'

 

 	'Enough, poor girl,' he answered. 'If I stayed, I would not be worth having.'

 

 	She ran to him, and, crying bitterly, held him in her arms. 'I shall hold you like this! You are mine!'

 
mux pulled himself away looked into her face for a long moment then ran to the water s edge He jumped into a canoe with Tamb Itam and as they moved away the girl screamed You are unfaithful 
 

 	'Forgive me!' he cried.

 

 	'Never!' she called back. 'Never!'

 
When mux arrived at Doramin s stockade the crowd of crying confused people separated respectfully and fearfully to allow him to enter He walked slowly through them right up to the old chief who was sitting in his usual chair with a gun on his knees Doramin s wife was bending miserably over her son s body which was covered with a sheet mux lifted the sheet to look at his dead friend then dropped it without a word He waited for a moment then said gently I am responsible I come in sadness with no weapon I am ready The heavy old man was helped up from his chair and the silver ring which mux had worn so proudly fell to the floor With an expression of mad pain and anger on his face 
 
Doramin stared at mux standing stiffly in front of him Then looking him straight in the eyes he lifted his gun and shot his son s friend through the chest mux looked proudly and bravely round at all the staring faces then with a hand over his lips he fell forward dead 
 

 	And that's the end. He disappears under a cloud, mysterious, forgotten, and much too romantic. Perhaps in that last, short moment he saw the face of his opportunity, waiting for him like an Eastern bride. He left the arms of a living woman who loved him, to marry the shadowy ghost of imagined honour and duty. Is he completely happy now, I wonder? We ought to know; he is one of us. Was I so very wrong, after all, to believe in him? Who knows? He is gone, and the poor girl is living a soundless, frozen life in Stein's house. Stein looks much older now, and is feeling his age. He often says he is 'preparing to leave all this', while he waves his hand sadly at his butterflies.
